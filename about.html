		  <h2>Our history</h2>
		  <div class="about-container">I'm Tania Caldera. I was born in Venezuela but I've been living in Ireland since 2018. My passion for baking started very early. My parents own a bakery in the small town where I grew (they still do!). My products are not only full of quality and delicious ingredients, but also with love. They are piece of family, a piece of home. And I hope you can feel that in every sweet (and savoury) bite!</div>
		  <div class="about-container"> We make everything from the traditional three milks cake and lemon pie to carrot and chocolate cakes, not to mention delicious contemporary breads and desserts. We are experts in occasion cakes and confectionary providing everything from bespoke birthday cakes to creative confectionary with custom decorations.</div>
